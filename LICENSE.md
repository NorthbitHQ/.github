# NorthbitHQ Organization-Wide Licensing Policy

This document outlines the licensing policy for all repositories within the NorthbitHQ GitHub organization. **This file is not a license itself** but a guide to our project licenses.

Each repository contains its own `LICENSE` file specifying the exact terms. To ensure consistency, individual repository `LICENSE` files should contain a reference to the full license text hosted in this `.github` repository.

## How to License a Repository

1.  **Determine the Category**: Choose one of the license categories below (e.g., Public, Source-Available, Confidential).
2.  **Create a `LICENSE` file**: In the root of your repository, create a `LICENSE` file.
3.  **Add a Reference**: In that `LICENSE` file, add a reference pointing to the appropriate license file in this `.github` repository.
